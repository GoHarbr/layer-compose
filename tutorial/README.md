# LayerCompose

LayerCompose is a small State Management utility library that combines the power of Mixins and Lenses, with additional safety checks.

It's main use case is encapsulation of state (in other words managing state safely) 
and allowing pieces of functionality to be split across multiple files to be mixed in different combinations

LayerCompose encourages simple, modular, reusable code patterns

The tutorial walks you through:
1. Layers and how they are mixed into Compositions
2. Basics of Instantiating and Using Compositions 
3. Services (or maybe more appropriately Lenses) and how they are attached to provide additional functionality
   while maintaining separation of concerns
4. Tips & tricks
5. Built-in safety checks


The tutorial consist of unit test files with comments used to guide and explain. 
This tutorial serves multiple purposes: to educate and to make sure that the codebase is functioning as expected!
